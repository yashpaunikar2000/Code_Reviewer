❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
• ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope.
• ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
• ✔ Accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making the function reusable.
• ✔ Properly adds `a` and `b` and returns the sum.

Final Note:
It's crucial to define where variables come from. In this case, passing `a` and `b` as parameters makes the function
both clear and functional. 🚀
